## Contributing

Everybody is welcome to contribute to Static Website Hosting, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cosmicjs/staticwebsitehosting) and send a pull request.
Each static website hosting provider is a `index.md` markdown file in the `content/sites/<name>/` directory.

Make sure to follow the following rules:

- **Static Website Hosting:** No server-side website hosting options. This means it needs to serve static content directly without involving PHP, Ruby, Node.js, Java, etc. The hosting provider must have the option to enable a CDN for optimized global static asset distribution which is one of the benefits of the Jamstack approach.
- **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other static website hosting providers in `content/sites`.
- **Short description:** Keep all the details for the body text, keep the description for the overview page short and sweet.
